# 📙 How it works in a Server-Rendered Form?

1. **vue-media-upload** component uploads the image `image.jpg` as multipart/form-data using a POST request.

2. **server** temporary saves the image with a unique name `123_image.jpg` in a `/tmp/uploads` folder.

3. **server** returns the unique name `123_image.jpg` in a request response.

4. **vue-media-upload** insert the unique name `123_image.jpg` in a hidden html input with `name="added_media[]"`.

5. **user** submits the component parent form, which includes the hidden input field containing the unique image name.

6. **server** uses the unique image name to move `123_image.jpg` from the `/tmp/uploads` folder to its final location.


# 🔣 Inputs

> **Note** that all this inputs are **hidden** and they are just a way to validate and pass data to the backend when using this package in a **Server-Rendered Form**!

| Name attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **added_media[]**  | The added images in the component |
| **removed_media[]**  | The images that have been removed from the stored media. |
| **media**  | This input is added, when the component has at least one image or more listed, as a way for the backend to validate the Images as being required. |
